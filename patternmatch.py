    '''
    This function finds paths in a directed graph that are consistent with a target pattern. The nodes
    of the directed graph are called walls, and each node is associated with a wall label (in walldomains)
    and a wall number (the index of the label in walldomains). The outgoing edges of a node with wall
    number w are stored in outedges at index w. Each element of outedges is a collection of wall numbers. 
    The graph is assumed to consist of a collection of nontrivial strongly connected components, since only 
    these nodes participate in cycles. (This reduction should have been performed in the preprocessing step.)

    The pattern is a sequence of words from the alphabet ('u','d','m','M'), with each word containing EXACTLY
    one 'm' or 'M'. The variable locations in walldomains will be transformed in a path-dependent manner into 
    words of the same type that have AT MOST one 'm' or 'M'. There can be at most one 'm' 
    or 'M' at each wall because we assume that the input graph arises from a switching network where each 
    regulation event occurs at a unique threshold. The paths in the graph that have word labels that 
    match the pattern will be returned as sequences of wall numbers. Intermediate wall labels may be inserted 
    into the pattern as long as they do not have an 'm' or 'M' in the label, and are consistent with the next 
    word in the pattern. Example: 'uMdd' in a four dimensional system means that the first variable is 
    increasing (up), the second variable is at a maximum (Max), and the third and fourth variables are 
    decreasing (down). The character 'm' means a variable is at a minimum (min). If the words 'uMdd' then 'udmd'
    appear in a pattern, the intermediate node 'uddd' may be inserted between these two in a match.

    The following variables are produced by the function preprocess in this module. See the code for more information.

    pattern: list of uniform-length words from the alphabet ('u','d','m','M'); exactly one 'm' or 'M' REQUIRED per string; patterns containing exactly repeating sequences will not be found if the same walls must be traversed to match the pattern
    origwallinds: list of integers denoting the original wall label in the full wall graph. The input data have been filtered to remove walls that cannot participate in a cycle, and the remaining walls have been renamed to the new indices of the filtered data. From now on, 'index wall n' means the wall associated with the index n in all of the filtered data.
    outedges: list of tuples of integers denoting a directed edge from the index wall to the tuple walls
    walldomains: list of tuples of floats denoting the variable values at the index wall
    varsaffectedatwall: list of integers reporting which variable is affected the index wall 
    allwalllabels: list of lists of uniform-length words from the alphabet ('u','d','m','M'); describing the possible wall labels at each node; at MOST there is one 'm' or 'M' per string

    showfirstwall and cyclewarn print informative messages for the user. By default, showfirstwall is turned off, since it exists only for tracking the progress of the code.

    See patternmatch_tests.py for examples of function calls.
